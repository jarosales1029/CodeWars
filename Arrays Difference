Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

#Comparing 2 lists given
def array_diff(a, b):
    workLst = []
    for i in a:
        count = 0
        if i == b[count]:
            count += 1
        else:
            workLst.append(i)
            count += 1
    return workLst
